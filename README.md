Project Overview

This project analyzes the applicant and academic records submitted by students applying for an MS in Computer Science/Education to then determine eligibility and target outreach strategies. Using Excel, I integrated various data sources with XLOOKUP and performed exploratory analysis using pivot tables. The analysis provides results that highlight which applicants/applicant groups are ready for next academic steps and which require additional documentation.
